### *I'm a young Full Stack developer, recently graduated with distinction from the HE2B, ESI*

I am a hard worker who is persevering, perfectionist and curious. I am constantly looking for ways to improve myself from a personal and professional point of view.  

It's been more than 3 years now that I'm improving myself in the different fields of computer science. And more precisely, concerning the aspect of project management, analysis, application development and web development!  

My native language is **french** but I can speak English easly.
